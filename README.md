## Problems with Alice, Bob, Carol, and Ted

At one point both partner sets were working on the main branch at the same time. No communication between group about branches and ACP's.  Git pull and git push should have been done more frequently.  They were working on the same file.  Overall communication and a plan were severely lacking.  Changes should not have been done so frequently at the end of the file. Inconsistency with procedures.  Clearly they did not attend Code Fellows!
